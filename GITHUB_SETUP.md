# GitHub Repository Setup

This document provides instructions on how to set up the GitHub repository for SITDELHI.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your system

## Steps to Set Up the GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository named "SITDELHI" on GitHub.

   - Enter "SITDELHI" as the repository name
   - Choose whether to make it public or private
   - Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Set up the local repository:
   - Navigate to the SITDELHI directory in your terminal
   - Initialize a git repository if it's not already initialized:
     ```
     git init
     ```
   - Add all files to the repository:
     ```
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit the changes:
     ```
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

3. Connect the local repository to the GitHub repository:
   - For Windows users, run:
     ```
     setup-github.bat yourusername
     ```
   - For Linux/Mac users, run:
     ```
     ./setup-github.sh yourusername
     ```
   - Replace "yourusername" with your GitHub username

4. Verify the setup:
   - Go to https://github.com/yourusername/SITDELHI
   - You should see all the project files there
